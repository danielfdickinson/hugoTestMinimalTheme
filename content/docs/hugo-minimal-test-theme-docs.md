# Hugo Minimal Test Theme
A minimum test theme to generate the full site of pages for [Hugo Basic Example Site](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugoBasicExample) (and other Hugo sites). Includes option to turn on the test styling (for a more realistic test).

Includes the ability to enable less minimal features via custom layouts (with thanks to members of the [Hugo Forum](https://discourse.gohugo.io) for their suggestions).

The purpose of the repo is not for CI or automated testing, but to have a set of layouts for creating minimum reproducible test cases for reporting bugs to the Hugo developers.

See [License](https://git.wildtechgarden.ca/danielfdickinson/hugoMinimalTestTheme/src/branch/master/LICENSE) for permissions on use.

## Modern Hugo Only (as of 2021-03-17)

This minimal theme is built using assumptions that may require Hugo 0.81.0 or higher, and in any event those are the only versions on which it has been tested, at present.

## Available Features

### A Note on Layout Feature Selection

As @davidsneighbour on the [Hugo Forum](https://discourse.gohugo.io) [suggested in response to my announcement of this theme](https://discourse.gohugo.io/t/a-theme-for-minimal-reproducible-test-casing/31790/6), features that are less 'minimal', but still needed in order to have a minimal reproducible test case for more complex (even if barely) situations than an absolute minimal theme, can be enabled through the use of custom layouts.

If a feature is listed in the table below, one can activate the feature on a page by adding ``layouts = "feature-layout"`` (for toml frontmatter) or ``layouts: feature-layout`` (for yaml frontmatter) to the page metadata in the page file in the ``contents`` directory. (One can also set per-page metadata in ``config.toml`` but for that see the [Hugo Documentation](https://gohugo.io/documentation/)).

Not that features are often specific to the type of page (e.g. list pages vs. single pages) and when that is the case it is noted under 'Applies to'.

This is possible through the magic of [Hugo's Lookup Order](https://gohugo.io/templates/lookup-order).

Obviously for ``feature-layout`` use the layout from the table below.

#### Layout Feature Table

| Feature                        | feature-layout        | Applies to              | Description |
|--------------------------------|-----------------------|-------------------------|-------------|
| Custom Layout Testing          | custom                | sections and single     | A generic custom layout (just announces it is a custom layout with a heading) that will work with both a section and a single page.          |
| Layout Order Testing           | layout-order          | sections and single     | A section page should display the section ``layout-order`` layout not the single page``layout-order`` layout. A single page should display the single page ``layout-order`` layout (the title will indicate which it is) |
| Layout Section Order Testing   | layout-section-order   | sections and single     | A section page should display a section ``layout-section-order`` layout not the single  page``layout-section-order`` layout for both typical sections as well as for pages in the special ``custom-section-layout-test`` section (directory). A single page should display the single page ``layout-section-order`` layout for both typical sections and a page in the special ``custom-section-layout-test`` section (directory). Once again the title will indicate which layout is in use. |
| Pagination                     | pagination            | section/list pages only | Displays a section as a list of the pages (both regular pages and section pages) in a section, dividing the list of pages in a section into separate sub-pages, each containing at most the number of pages from the section that is defined in the config's ``pagination`` setting (default 10). |

### Custom Sections

* Currently only ``custom-section-layout-test`` has special layouts one can choose to use with the section pages, or pages in the section (see "Layout Section Order Testing" above), although the section also has 'standalone' layout (i.e. without layout ``layout-section-order`` required).

### Custom Taxonomy

* Currently only ``taxonomy-test-taxonomy``
* To use it:
  * In ``config.toml`` have a section such as the following (with the appropriate taxonomies for your site):
    ```
    [taxonomies]
      category = "categories"
      tag = "tags"
      taxonomy-test-taxonomy = "taxonomy-test-taxonomies"
    ```
  * In page frontmatter that should be using the taxonomy (assuming toml frontmatter):
    ```
    taxonomy-test-taxonomies = ["term1","term2"]
    ```

### hello-world Shortcode

A simple shortcode that emits an HTML paragraph with 'Hello World!'. To use it,
add ``{{\< hello-world>}}`` to a **content** file (not template).
## Usage

1. Clone a site, for example hugoBasicExample and switch to it
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/gohugoio/hugoBasicExample
   cd hugoBasicExample
   ```
### Using Hugo Modules (preferred)

1. Initialize the Hugo module system: ``hugo mod init github.com/<your_user>/<your_project>`` (assuming you are using github, of course).
2. Import the theme in your ``config.html``
   ```
   [module]
     [[module.imports]]
        path = "git.wildtechgarden.ca/danielfdickinson/hugoMinimalTestTheme"
   ```
3. Change back to the site directory
4. Get the module
   ```
   hugo mod get git.wildtechgarden.ca/danielfdickinson/hugoMinimalTestTheme
   ```
5. To test the result, run the local Hugo server
   ```
   hugo server -b http://localhost:1313/
   ```
### Using downloaded copy of the theme (e.g. Zip from Github)

1. Make a themes directory and switch to it
   ```
   mkdir themes
   cd themes
   ```

2. Obtain a copy of the theme e.g. ([a theme Zip file from Github](https://git.wildtechgarden.ca/danielfdickinson/hugoMinimalTestTheme/archive/master.zip))
3. Copy/extract the theme into hugoMinimalTestTheme in the themes directory
4. Change back to the site directory
5. To test the result, run the local Hugo server
   ```
   hugo server -t hugoMinimalTestTheme -b http://localhost:1313/
   ```
### Using git submodules (deprecated)

1. Make a themes directory and switch to it
   ```
   mkdir themes
   cd themes
   ```

2. In the themes directory, add hugoMinimalTestTheme as a submodule
   ```
   git submodule add -f https://git.wildtechgarden.ca/danielfdickinson/hugoMinimalTestTheme.git
   ```
3. Change back to the site directory
4. To test the result, run the local Hugo server
   ```
   hugo server -t hugoMinimalTestTheme -b http://localhost:1313/
   ```

 Enjoy!

## Change Debug Table from Development Only

See full [hugoDebugTable README.md](https://git.wildtechgarden.ca/danielfdickinson/hugoDebugTables/src/branch/master/README.md)
for information on using the debug table included in this theme.
### To add to production builds

In ``config.toml`` add

```toml
[params]
     debugTableEnvironment = ["development","production"]
```

### To never include in builds

```toml
[params]
     debugTableEnvironment = [""]
```

**NB** The ``""`` is required because an empty slice (or no param) defaults to ``["development"]``

### You can also use custom environments

In ``config.toml`` add

```toml
[params]
     debugTableEnvironment = ["custom1","custom2"]
```

And of course if you wanted you could add ``"development"`` and/or ``"production"``

## Params for parts of the layout
To disable some layout in the table below:

In ``config.toml`` add

```toml
[params]
     <param listed below> = false
```

| Param                    | Description                                    |
|--------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| showTopBar               | If false, do not show top menu bar             |
| testStylesInclude        | If true adds old browser warning because the offending styles are also enabled (see below). |

## Test CSS Styling

To make the theme more 'real' a silly basic style has been added (using 'Comic Sans MS' font no less!). The styling does require a modern browser (that means no Internet Explorer; not even IE11).

To enable the styles:

In ``config.toml`` add

```toml
[params]
     testStylesInclude = true
```
### For the Debug Tables

For the parts of styles that apply to the debug tables, see [hugoDebugTables README.md](https://git.wildtechgarden.ca/danielfdickinson/hugoDebugTables/src/branch/master/README.md)

### For the theme itself

Two types of classes available:

   * Element classes (e.g. bar-test-min)
      * By actual use of element not the HTML element type (e.g. ``div`` usually wants to stand for something specific).
      * May include a hyphen in the element type part
      * Always end in ``-test-min`` to denote they are 'minimal test theme' classes
   * Category/Purpose Classes
      * E.g. ``test-mainmenu-min`` which is wrapped around HTML for page main menu
      * Always begin with ``test`` and ends in ``min``. The middle is a single word (no hyphens).
